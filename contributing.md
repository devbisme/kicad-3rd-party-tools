## Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request (PR) adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions/additions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your addition is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and a good, succinct description.
- Make an individual PR for each addition.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the **bottom** of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- **The PR and commit should have a useful title.** PRs with `Update readme.md` as their title will be closed right away.

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of this list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the list's guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a PR, and the different ways you can do that.
